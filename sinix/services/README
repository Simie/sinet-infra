### Usage

To start a stack:

sudo ./service-compose <stack name> up \[-d\]

-d to detatch.

Service stacks are usually started/stopped via systemd - see configuration.nix

### service-compose

Simple helper script to call docker-compose with the directory set correctly, and include all the env files (<stack folder>/settings.env, ./shared.env, <secrets_dir>/secrets.env)
